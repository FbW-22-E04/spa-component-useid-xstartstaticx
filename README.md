# SPA-COMPONENT-useId

***useId*** is a ***hook*** for generating ***unique IDs*** that are stable across the server and client, while avoiding ***hydration mismatches***

***useId*** is ***not for generating keys in a list***. Keys should be generated from your data.

##  What you will be doing.

You will complete an form component using id generated by useId and you will observe in detail how this hook works. 

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Create the form

Use the ***InputForm*** component to create a form where you will have three inputs with its corresponding labels, exactly as in the picture below.
There is already a css but you can improve it.

### Task 2 - Fix the problem

What is the problem? The labels attribute ***htmlFor*** gives us the ability that if we click in the label we will have the ***focus*** in the input it is linked with, to do this we gave both the id attribute and htmlFor the same value.
But all three components in App.js now have ***the same ids and htmlFor*** so we will always have the focus in the first input.
Use ***useId Hook*** to solve the problem.

## BONUS TASKS:

### Task 3 - Another solution

Try not using useId and solve the problem with another solution and note how easy is the useId solution.

The great thing about useId is that ***the same id will be regenerated for each component each time it is rendered***, if you use solution like ***Math.random()*** this will not happen.
